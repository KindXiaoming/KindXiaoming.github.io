I gave many talks at different venues on various topics. Unfortunately, only very few of them are recorded and released to the public. Hopefully these public videos can give you a flavor of what I'm excited about:

* KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks ([Valance Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUDHb-tnlB0))
* GenPhys: From Physical Processes to Generative Models ([Valence Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTKkRde9wkE), [GenAI in STEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVEV3g_URZw))
* Brain-inspired modular training and Growing Brains ([Cognitive Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxwlxb2XWw), [Prof. Michael Levin's Academic Content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zquh-J7Hxn8))
