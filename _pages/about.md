Hi! I'm Ziming, currently a postdoc at Stanford & Enigma, working with Prof. Andreas Tolias. <!--[Get my CV here](/assets/pdf/Ziming_resume.pdf).--> I obtained my PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Max Tegmark. Before that, I obtained my B.S. from Peking University. My research interests lie in the intersection of AI and Science:

* Science of AI: Understanding AI using science. I'm interested in understanding intriguing network phenomena (e.g., grokking, neural scaling laws). 
* Science for AI: Advancing AI using science. When the scaling of the current paradigm plateaus, it is time to focus back on fundamental science (for AI).
* AI for Science: Advancing science using AI. I'm excited about inventing accurate/interpretable AI4Science models and curiosity-driven AI scientists.

I am grateful to the Quanta magazine (among other media outlets) which has covered all three branches of my research. Consider reading if you want to get some taste:

* Science of AI (Grokking): [How Do Machines ‘Grok’ Data?](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-do-machines-grok-data-20240412/)
* Science for AI (Poisson Flow): [The Physical Process That Powers a New Type of Generative AI](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-physics-inspired-generative-ai-exceeds-expectations-20230919/)
* AI for Science (KAN): [Novel Architecture Makes Neural Networks More Understandable](https://www.quantamagazine.org/novel-architecture-makes-neural-networks-more-understandable-20240911/)

My research philosophy is best described by John Hopfield's inspiring words in his Nobel lecture:

> **[About physics]** Physics is not defined by subject matter, but is a point of view that the world around us (with effort, ingenuity and adequete resources) is understandable in a predictive and reasonably quantitative fashion. 

> **[About choosing problems]** I am now looking for a big problem whose resolution and understanding will be of significance far beyond its normal disciplinary boundaries and will reorganize the fields from which they came.

<!--To break disciplinary boundaries, I am decicated to bring young talents into this exciting field of AI + Science, as well as bring together AI researchers and domain scientists. I'm excited to teach courses on AI + Science when opportunities arise. Take a look at the syllabus for [Science of AI](/assets/pdf/Science_of_AI_Syllabus.pdf) and [AI for Science](/assets/pdf/AI_for_Science_Syllabus.pdf) that I'm designing and let me know if you would be interested in signup if such courses exist!-->
