Hi! I'm Ziming, a fourth-year PhD student at MIT & IAIFI, advised by Prof. Max Tegmark. [Get my CV here](/assets/pdf/Ziming_resume.pdf). My research interests lie in the intersection of AI and physics (science in general):

* Physics of AI: "AI as simple as physics"
* Physics for AI: "AI as natural as physics"
* AI for physics: "AI as powerful as physicists"

Serving the ultimtate goal of building a better world using AI + Science, I have interests in a broad range of topics, including but not limited to AI Scientists, physics-inspired deep learning, science of deep learning, mechanistic interpretability, etc. I publish papers both in top physics journals and AI conferences. I serve as a reviewer for Physcial Reviews, NeurIPS, ICLR, IEEE, etc. I co-organized the AI4Science workshops. 

I love working with collaborators from various scientific backgrounds, and my research have strong interdisciplinary nature, e.g., Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (Math for AI), Poisson Flow Generative Models (Physics for AI), Brain-inspired modular training (Neuroscience for AI), understanding Grokking (physics of AI), conservation laws and symmetries (AI for physics).
