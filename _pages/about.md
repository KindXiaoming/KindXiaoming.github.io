Hi! I'm **Ziming Liu** (刘子鸣). I will join the [College of AI](https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor, starting 2026 Fall. I did my postdoc in AI + Neuroscience at Stanford with Andreas Tolias. I did my PhD in AI + Physics at MIT with Max Tegmark. Before that, I obtained my B.S. in physics from Peking University in 2020. [Get my CV here](/assets/pdf/Ziming_resume.pdf).

I'm currently devoted to two related things:
* **"Physics of AI"** -- using first principles to understand the structure ("Google map") of AI research/idea/design space.
* **"AI for AI"** -- building an AI agent that can intelligently navigate through the map of ideas, like human AI researchers. 

I believe both the AI agent and the "physics of AI" knowledge base will become key ingredients of a **safe and efficient AGI**, which naturally supports **curiosity-driven continual learning**.

Over a longer time scale, my research interests generally lie in the intersection of AI and Science:

* Science of AI: Understanding AI using science. I'm interested in understanding intriguing network phenomena (e.g., grokking, neural scaling laws). 
* Science for AI: Advancing AI using science. When the scaling of the current paradigm plateaus, it is time to focus back on fundamental science (for AI).
* AI for Science: Advancing science using AI. I'm excited about inventing accurate/interpretable AI4Science models and curiosity-driven AI scientists.

Consider reading these Quanta articles if you want to get some taste of my research:

* Science of AI (Grokking): [How Do Machines ‘Grok’ Data?](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-do-machines-grok-data-20240412/)
* Science for AI (Poisson Flow): [The Physical Process That Powers a New Type of Generative AI](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-physics-inspired-generative-ai-exceeds-expectations-20230919/)
* AI for Science (KAN): [Novel Architecture Makes Neural Networks More Understandable](https://www.quantamagazine.org/novel-architecture-makes-neural-networks-more-understandable-20240911/)

<!--My research philosophy is best described by John Hopfield's inspiring words in his Nobel lecture:

> **[About physics (of AI)]** Physics is not defined by subject matter, but is a point of view that the world around us (with effort, ingenuity and adequete resources) is understandable in a predictive and reasonably quantitative fashion. 

> **[About choosing problems]** I am now looking for a big problem whose resolution and understanding will be of significance far beyond its normal disciplinary boundaries and will reorganize the fields from which they came.-->

<!--To break disciplinary boundaries, I am decicated to bring young talents into this exciting field of AI + Science, as well as bring together AI researchers and domain scientists. I'm excited to teach courses on AI + Science when opportunities arise. Take a look at the syllabus for [Science of AI](/assets/pdf/Science_of_AI_Syllabus.pdf) and [AI for Science](/assets/pdf/AI_for_Science_Syllabus.pdf) that I'm designing and let me know if you would be interested in signup if such courses exist!-->
